[Intro]
Talked to the patron trooper about a male subject that's repeatedly been driving by his residence
Think it's tied into a new girlfriend

[Verse 1]
Spend the night and I will make it worth your while
Let's build a life we can both live out in style
Come into the light, don't you think to run a mile
If you spend the night with me
I will make it worth your while
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, invest time in me
Cause I am risk free
We can make this work
That's my guarantee
Oh, show me how to love you
So we can go far
We can make it work
Yeah, we can make it

[Chorus]
If your love is with me
You'll be my baby
Oh, yes you will
Oh, yes you will
If your lips are near me
You'll be my baby
Oh, yes you will
Oh, yes you will

[Verse 2]
Spend the night and we will make it worth the while
Let's plan that life, we can give this thing a trial
Lift up your head, won't you let me see that smile?
If you spend the night with me
I will make it worth your while

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, invest time in me
Cause I am risk free
We can make this work
That's my guarantee
Oh show me how to love you
So we can go far
We can make it work
Girl, we can make it

[Chorus]
If your love is with me
You'll be my baby
Oh, yes you will
Oh, yes you will
If your lips are near me
You'll be my baby
Oh, yes you will
Oh, yes you will

[Bridge]
Spend the night and I will make it worth your while
Let's build a life that we can both live out in style
Come into the light, and don't you think to run a mile
If you spend the night with me
I will make it worth your while

[Chorus]
If your love is with me
You'll be my baby
Oh, yes you will
Oh, yes you will
If your lips are near me
You'll be my baby
Oh, yes you will
Oh, yes you will
If your love is with me
You'll be my baby
Oh, yes you will
Oh, yes you will
If your lips are near me
You'll be my baby
Oh, yes you will
Oh, yes you will
