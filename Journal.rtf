\f1\fs36 Today we had our first class in Python. We learned about version control systems (VCS). We also learned about repositories and what it means in computer science. We created an online repository with GitHub and also a local one and linked it together. We also learned several new commands, regarding the usage of GIT. Although, we didn\'92t dive immediately into Python today, I am happy that we are taking baby steps in the first few classes. I didn\'92t touch programming all throughout summer and I certainly do appreciate the pace right now. Overall, I am really excited for this course and what it has to offer. I hope that I am able to use Python effectively by the end of this course.}
