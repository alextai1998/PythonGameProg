Today we started for the first time to learn about Python. We did an in class research project with some of the basic built-in functions of the Python language. We also learned about the history of the Python language. We learned that the newest version of the language is Python 3 and that most people are upset that Python 3 removes most of the conventions of Python 2. We also learned about different paradigms and researched the differences between an Imperative paradigm and a Declarative Paradigm on Stack Overflow.
