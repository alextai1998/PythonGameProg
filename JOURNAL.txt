Today we had our first class in Python. We learned about version control systems (VCS). We also learned about repositories and what it means in computer science. We created an online repository with GitHub and also a local one and linked it together. We also learned several new commands, regarding the usage of GIT. Although, we didn’t dive immediately into Python today, I am happy that we are taking baby steps in the first few classes. I didn’t touch programming all throughout summer and I certainly do appreciate the pace right now. Overall, I am really excited for this course and what it has to offer. I hope that I am able to use Python effectively by the end of this course.

Today was a short period class so we didn’t do any new lectures. We, however, used the time to review some of the exercises we learned on Monday. We added new files, and folders. Learned how to add a whole folder into the working tree and also learned how to commit the whole folder. I also learned that “origin” is supposed to stand in for the URL of our remote repo. This is pretty awesome since we wouldn’t have to type down our whole https URL in the future every time we wish to upload our changes. I was struggling to push my local repository into my GitHub account because apparently the files on my remote repo don’t correspond with the files on my local repo and they automatically assume that another local repo might have pushed their stuff onto the remote repo. I learned that we can solve this by adding “-f” so that it forces the push command.
