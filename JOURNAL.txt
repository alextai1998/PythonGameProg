Today we learned about dictionaries and also compared it to lists. We figured out some of the differing methods that
dictionaries and lists have. Dictionaries have the methods : del, clear, copy, fromkeys, get, items, keys, values
del is similar to the remove method of lists; clear, as the name suggests, clears all the values and the keys from the
existing dictionary. fromkeys can be used to mass assign values; get is similar to just calling a value but allows
default set up. Lastly, items, keys, and values return the things the name of the method suggests. For items, the method
returns the keys and the values as a tuple pair side by side. For our homework, we need to figure out what a function is
doing. The function includes a list.
