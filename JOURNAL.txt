OMG…so it has been a while since I’ve updated my journal because I have been super busy with SATs and college essays. In order to tackle this issue, I have not set an alarm clock every Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday to remind me to write a journal entry. Today in class, we worked ever more on the lego distinguisher challenge. I just finished the program but I’m not sure if it is correct.
